# pwnhyve
P.S. this project is not dead - i have plans for it (view bottom of readme), but my pi's screen broke and amazon refuses to send me another   
also been working on other projects (as you can see on my profile, azamuku is the one i'm working on as we speak) and schoolwork

a pi-zero powered hacking tool, with badusb capabilities, on the fly hoaxshell payload generation, 802.11 deauthing, bettercap support, and (crude) duckyscript support, all in the size of a flipper zero (or raspberry pi depending on your setup)

### DISCLAIMER
i am not responsible for what you do with this thing; this can actually be used for really bad purposes in the right hands  
this also isn't meant to be better than the p4wnp1-aloa - the aloa has way more support for everything than me
if support/something you want isn't implemented yet, look at making plugins unless its something else - in that case, [make an issue](https://github.com/woahotter/pwnhyve/issues/new)

# NOTICE
- deauthing works, but can sometimes go silent (see https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/issues/267)

# BILL OF MATERIALS
- a raspberry pi zero w (can also be a 2)

## OPTIONAL
### battery (DO NOT BUY IF YOUR GETTING A USB STEM)
- [pisugar 2 portable](https://www.tindie.com/products/pisugar/pisugar-2-battery-for-raspberry-pi-zero/)
- [waveshare ups hat](https://www.waveshare.com/ups-hat-c.htm)
- [or create your own battery](https://github.com/nototter/pwnhyve/wiki/making-your-own-pi-zero-battery-ups)
- [you could plug it into your phone](https://www.amazon.com/Cable-Matters-Micro-Braided-Jacket/dp/B0746NHSCZ) 

### display
- [waveshare 1.3inch oled](https://www.waveshare.com/wiki/1.3inch_OLED_HAT)
### usb stems for quick insertion (DO NOT BUY IF YOUR GETTING A BATTERY PACK)
- [pi zero stem 1](https://zerostem.io/)
- [pi zero stem 2 w/o battery support](https://www.amazon.com/risingsaplings-Connector-Expansion-Breakout-Raspberry/dp/B0924TM6NJ)

- note: you could use a tiny micro-usb cable with sync support and plug that in to the victim

## why battery?
if you try to use your pi as a ducky usb, it will take (minimum) 25 seconds to boot up and start pwnhyve, and a couple of minutes to start everything else up; not very stealthy

you could use it without a battery though, just not reccomended

# how install?
go into the wiki to install

# credit
- 98% of this was made by me
- some of it was from [pwnagotchi](https://github.com/evilsocket/pwnagotchi/) for deauthing

# TBD
- SourApple attacks
- custom ble frames
- radiofrequency hacking with cc1101 (requires custom pcb shim)
- nfc emulation (requires custom pcb shim)
- actual good pcb shim for a BMS, instead of wires poking out
- custom pi display hat using cheap oleds and buttons w/ bumpers mimicing an xbox controller (need this done ASAP) (should be under 10$ to make)
